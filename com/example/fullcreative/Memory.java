             faster


    heap :  all obj created stored here and entire application can accees it
            OutofMemoryError
            slower
            garbage collector everytime clear memeory here


            Memory Leaks : unused obj unnecessary in memory as they are still referenced  (outofmemory error)

            reasons : using excesssive static variables ( as they remain in program until it ends)
                      when connections are not closed
